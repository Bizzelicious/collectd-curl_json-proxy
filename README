This is a workaround to make the curl_json plugin use a different User Agent when curling.
The need for a workaround was noticed when trying to make the curl_json plugin query JMX-results from jolokia/hawtio on EAP/AMQ-servers.
See Issue: https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/1212

Put the script in the www-folder of your favorite web server, just make sure to have PHP installed.

Configure the curl_json plugin like the following:

<URL "http://<webbserver>/curl.php?url=<page_to_curl>&user=admin&pass=admin">
        Instance "Instance_name"
        <Key "value">
                Type "your_value"
        </Key>
</URL>


Example which will curl the site on vl-amqutv01 via the server vl-collector01:

<URL "http://vl-collector01/curl.php?url=vl-amqutv01:8181/hawtio/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=ClassLoading/LoadedClassCount&user=admin&pass=password">
        Instance ".vl-amqutv01.LoadedClassCount"
        <Key "value">
                Type "gauge"
        </Key>
</URL>

This example will request LoadedClasscount on the AMQ and will provide the following result:
{"timestamp":1452640185,"status":200,"request":{"mbean":"java.lang:type=ClassLoading","attribute":"LoadedClassCount","type":"read"},"value":14802}
